Currently, I work as a Post-Doctoral Fellow at the University of Missouri, Kansas City School of Medicine with the Community Health Research Group. We partner with community and faith-based organizations to address health disparities such as HIV/AIDS, diabetes, heart disease and stroke; and mental health among African American congregants and community members in the Kansas City, Missouri and Kansas area. As a TL1-Post Doctoral Fellow, I recieved grant funding to culturally and religiously tailor the ARTAS-strength based system to increase the number of African Americans living with HIV, linked and retained in care. In addition, I am the primary investigator of a community health needs assessment for African American men who have sex with men in tandem with a local African American MSM community coalition, and the co-investigator of a multisite college student sexual health study.
